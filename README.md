The purpose of this branch is to test the following benchmarks on KVM...

Benchmarks: Linpack, Stream

To run the installation of the VM, instantiate the kvm branch on CloudLab using this repository and run the following:
sudo bash /local/repository/install_kvm.sh

The installation is fully automated and does not require user input, however, at this time the console is non-responsive after reboot of the host OS.
